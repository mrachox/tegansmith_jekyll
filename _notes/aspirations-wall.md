<span style="color:#808080;">Sometime during an average lifetime, a person will inhale a fragment of the air exhaled by Julius Caesar. In 1995 I began to work on manifestations of power through the breath, electricity and air. I have investigated diverse visual and mechanical means of representing the breath. The project began with my own respiratory allergies, a tangle of tubes left over from my father’s oxygen tanks. I built machines to replicate the process of breathing, videotaped and photographed breath, and used punctuation marks to symbolize the breath’s function in the voice.</span>

<span style="color:#808080;">The first *Aspirations Wall* was as a part of my York University MFA exhibition. It was 40 feet long and displayed a collection of objects, images and photographs dealing with the breath, flight and air, and 5 bookworks called *Beginning Aspirations*. The punctuation was traced from translations of classic Greek texts: Plato, *Republic*; Homer, *The Odyssey* and *Iliad*; Aristotle, *The Politics*; Aristophanes, *The Birds*; and Sophocles, *Oedipus Rex*. The wall was divided horizontally by cyan-colored string to look like an enlarged notebook page, and was broken into phrases by clay punctuation marks. </span>

<span style="color:#808080;">Shorter versions of the wall were shown in other venues. Later *Aspiration*s books included *Gray’s Anatomy*, Agatha Christie’s *The Blue Train* and the first book on punctuation published in English titled *A Treatise of Stops, Point, or Pauses, 1680.* This book was published at the time idiosyncratic manuscript punctuation based on taking breaths was transformed to structured phrasing in written language as printing press technology spread to book production. </span>

<span style="color:#808080;">*Scriptless Scriptorium* became a separate installation with a scroll of traced punctuation from each book of *The Holy Bible, Revised Standard Version*.</span>
