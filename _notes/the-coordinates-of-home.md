<span style="color:#808080;">This piece from my *Floodgates* series (see website) began 20 years ago with an Ontario Department of Mines map called *Lake Iroquois* (A.P. Coleman, 1936). The *Lost Rivers* group provided more resources. Later I found other organizations active on Great Lakes issues. This map is oriented to Queen Street, slightly off due East. Various mapping sources included the Toronto grid chart from Geoff Boeing’s *Urban Street Network Orientation*website. Water health and this showcase series theme of women aging with disabilities determined my inclusion choices. Generalizations resulted from source discrepancies and fluctuating shorelines. This map is not intended for navigation.</span>
