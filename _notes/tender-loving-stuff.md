<span style="color:#808080;">*Tender Loving Stuff (TLS)* is series of social media projects dedicated to philanthropy toward all material things*. TLS* produces a YouTube video series, <span style="color:#00ccff;">[Haul Out (2010-)](https://www.youtube.com/user/TLS1HO/videos) </span>about attachments to possessions with regard to economic prosperity, transgressive greed, waste and fondness for particular things. The [Tender Loving Stuff ](https://www.facebook.com/Tender-Loving-Stuff-310586688971029/)Facebook page was started in the hope of establishing a charitable foundation to advocate for inanimate objects. A paper titled [Haul Out Goodbyes](http://isea2011.sabanciuniv.edu/paper/haul-out-%E2%80%93-goodbyes) was presented at the 2011 ISEA conference in Istanbul.</span>

<span style="color:#808080;">The November, 2017 launch of the *Tender Loving Stuff* blog and its first series called *[Apologies to all my Stuff](https://tenderlovingstuff.com)* marks the anniversary of the first *Haul Out* video which was posted on Black Friday or Buy Nothing Day, 2010.</span>
