<span style="color:#808080;">“ Floodgates is part of a larger, more encompassing project that is at once highly personal and geological in scope. Smith has extensively researched both the location of her family homestead in the Mossy Vale district of Saskatchewan and the original contours of Lake Iroquois, the ancient, glacial Lake Ontario, whose shores passed near to her current Toronto home. Represented by maps mounted on the gallery walls, the maps present a picture of the complex relationship between water and land as they intersect with human life, the one driven by the politics of settlement and energy, the other by the staggering scale of geological time.”</span>
