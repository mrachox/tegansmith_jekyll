<span style="color:#808080;">The Admiralty Shoreline represents the lowest level of Lake Ontario since the last ice age. This video installation footage was shot with seven cameras from a boat travelling along the Toronto section of that contour. Thank you to camera operators Teresa Ascencao, Emma Eichner, Johann Louw, Alisdair MacRae and Samantha Staves, and to skipper Manuel Cappel.</span>
